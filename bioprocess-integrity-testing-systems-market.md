<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioprocess Integrity Testing Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Destructive Testing</li><li>Non-Destructive Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioprocess integrity testing systems are crucial in ensuring the quality and safety of bioprocessing systems. They can be categorized into two main types: destructive testing and non-destructive testing. Destructive testing involves methods that compromise the integrity of the sample, such as pressure testing or leak detection, which can provide definitive results but destroy the sample. In contrast, non-destructive testing maintains the sampleâ€™s integrity, utilizing techniques like dye penetration or ultrasonic testing, allowing for continuous monitoring without damage.</p></p>
