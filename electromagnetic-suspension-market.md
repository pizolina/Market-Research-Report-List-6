<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Active Suspension</li><li>Semi-Active Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electromagnetic suspension market comprises two primary types: pure active suspension and semi-active suspension. Pure active suspension systems use electromagnetic forces to control the vehicle's position and motion in real time, providing superior ride comfort and handling. In contrast, semi-active suspension systems adjust the suspension characteristics dynamically but rely on passive components for basic support. While both types enhance vehicle performance and stability, pure active systems offer more precise control, whereas semi-active systems are generally more cost-effective and simpler to implement.</p></p>
