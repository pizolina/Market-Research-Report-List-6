<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathodic Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanic</li><li>Impressed Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathodic protection systems are used to prevent corrosion on metal surfaces. There are two main types of systems: Galvanic and Impressed Current. Galvanic systems use sacrificial anodes that corrode instead of the metal structure, while Impressed Current systems use an external power source to drive electrons to counteract the corrosion. The Galvanic market is characterized by simplicity and lower cost, making it ideal for smaller-scale applications. On the other hand, the Impressed Current market is more commonly used for larger structures and offers a higher degree of control and efficiency.</p></p>
