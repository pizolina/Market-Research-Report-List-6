<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safty Overflow Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Type Overflow Valve</li><li>Bar Type Overflow Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The safety overflow valve market consists of two primary types: spring type and bar type overflow valves. Spring type overflow valves utilize a spring mechanism to regulate pressure, allowing fluids to escape when pressure exceeds safe limits. These are widely used in various industries due to their reliability and simple design. Bar type overflow valves, on the other hand, offer a more robust solution, using a bar mechanism to manage flow and pressure, making them ideal for high-capacity applications. Both types ensure system safety and prevent overpressure situations.</p></p>
