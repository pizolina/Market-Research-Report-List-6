<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The damper actuators market is divided into two main types: non-spring return and spring return damper actuators. Non-spring return actuators use electric motors to control dampers without relying on springs for return functionality, providing precise control and flexibility in applications. In contrast, spring return actuators incorporate a spring mechanism that automatically returns the damper to a default position when power is lost, ensuring safety and energy efficiency. Both types play crucial roles in HVAC systems, enhancing air quality and temperature regulation.</p></p>
