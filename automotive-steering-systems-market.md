<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Steering Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EPS</li><li>HPS</li><li>EHPS</li><li>MS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive steering systems can be categorized into four main types: Electric Power Steering (EPS), Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro-Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Mechanical Steering (MS). EPS uses an electric motor to assist steering, enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing weight. HPS relies on hydraulic pressure generated by a pump, offering strong maneuverability. EHPS combines electrical and hydraulic elements for improved responsiveness. MS, the traditional system, uses a direct mechanical link between the steering wheel and wheels, providing reliability without assistance.</p></p>
