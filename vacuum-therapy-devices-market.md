<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Devices</li><li>Vacuum Constriction Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum therapy devices encompass two primary market types: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) devices and Vacuum Constriction Devices (VCDs). NPWT devices aid in wound healing by applying controlled negative pressure to promote tissue granulation and fluid removal, commonly used in surgical or chronic wounds. Conversely, VCDs are designed for erectile dysfunction treatment, creating a vacuum to enhance blood flow to the penis. Both categories leverage negative pressure principles, but serve distinct medical purposes and patient needs.</p></p>
