<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound</li><li>Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) market can be divided into two main types: non-targeted and targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Non-targeted CEUS involves the use of contrast agents that enhance the overall imaging of tissues and blood flow without specific targeting of particular structures, making it useful for general assessments. In contrast, targeted CEUS utilizes contrast agents designed to bind to specific cellular markers or pathological sites, allowing for more precise imaging of tumors or vascular conditions, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.</p></p>
