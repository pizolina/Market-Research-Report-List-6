<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Mass Flow Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal mass flow sensors are categorized into two primary types: contact and non-contact. Contact type sensors measure flow by directly interacting with the fluid, using a heating element and temperature sensors to detect changes in thermal conductivity. Non-contact types, on the other hand, utilize infrared or other sensing technologies to measure flow without physical interaction, offering advantages like reduced maintenance and minimal contamination risks. Both types serve critical roles across various industries, ensuring precise flow measurement and control.</p></p>
