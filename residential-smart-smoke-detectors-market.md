<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Smart Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoelectric</li><li>Dual Sensors</li><li>Ionization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Residential smart smoke detectors come in three main types: photoelectric, dual sensors, and ionization. Photoelectric detectors use light to detect smoke particles, making them effective at detecting smoldering fires. Dual sensor detectors combine both photoelectric and ionization technologies, providing comprehensive fire detection for both smoldering and fast-flaming fires. Ionization detectors use a small amount of radioactive material to ionize air particles, making them sensitive to fast-flaming fires. Each type of detector offers unique advantages and is suited for different types of fires.</p></p>
