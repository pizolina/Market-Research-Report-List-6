<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Bus Charging Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wired Charging</li><li>Wireless Charging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric bus charging infrastructure market encompasses two primary types: wired charging and wireless charging. Wired charging involves direct physical connections to the bus using charging stations, providing efficient energy transfer. This method is commonly used at bus depots and along routes with fixed charging points. In contrast, wireless charging utilizes electromagnetic fields to transfer energy, allowing buses to recharge without physical connectors. This method enhances convenience and can be integrated into roadways for dynamic charging during operation, improving operational efficiency.</p></p>
