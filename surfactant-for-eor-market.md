<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surfactant for EOR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anionic Sulfonate</li><li>Anionic Carboxylate</li><li>Nonionic Surfactant</li><li>Biosurfactant</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surfactants in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are classified based on their ionic properties and structure. Anionic sulfonates are effective in reducing surface tension and improving oil displacement in saline environments. Anionic carboxylates also provide excellent interfacial tension reduction. Nonionic surfactants, with their neutral charge, are versatile and less sensitive to salinity. Biosurfactants, derived from biological materials, are eco-friendly and biodegradable, offering sustainable solutions. Other surfactants may include cationic or zwitterionic types, each serving specific operational needs in oil recovery.</p></p>
